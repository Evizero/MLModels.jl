Efficient Sum and Mean
=========================

In many situations we are not really that interested in the
individual loss values (or derivatives) of each observation, but
the sum or mean of them; be it weighted or unweighted. For
example, by computing the unweighted mean of the loss for our
training set, we would effectively compute what is known as the
empirical risk. This is usually the quantity (or an important
part of it) that the are interesting in minimizing.

When we say "weighted" or "unweighted", we are referring to
whether we are explicitly specifying the influence of individual
observations on the result. "Weighing" an observation is achieved
by multiplying its value with some number (i.e. the "weight" of
that observation). As a consequence that weighted observation
will have a stronger or weaker influence on the result.
In order to weigh an observation we have to know which array
dimension (if there are more than one) denotes the observations.
On the other hand, for computing an unweighted result we don't
actually need to know anything about the meaning of the array
dimensions, as long as the ``targets`` and the ``outputs`` are of
compatible shape and size.

The naive way to compute such an unweighted reduction, would be
to call ``mean`` or ``sum`` on the result of the element-wise
operation. The following code snipped show an example of that. We
say "naive", because it will not give us an acceptable
performance.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), [1.,2,3], [2,5,-2])
   3-element Array{Float64,1}:
    1.0
    3.0
    5.0

   # WARNING: Bad code
   julia> sum(value(L1DistLoss(), [1.,2,3], [2,5,-2]))
   9.0

This works as expected, but there is a price for it. Before the
sum can be computed, ``value`` will allocate a temporary array
and fill it with the element-wise results. After that, ``sum``
will iterate over this temporary array and accumulate the values
accordingly. Bottom line: we allocate temporary memory that we
don't need in the end and could avoid.

For that reason we provide special methods that compute the
common accumulations efficiently without allocating temporary
arrays. These methods can be invoked using an additional
parameter which specifies how the values should be accumulated /
averaged. The type of this parameter has to be a subtype of
``AverageMode``.

Average Modes
---------------

Before we discuss these memory-efficient methods, let us briefly
introduce the available average mode types. We provide a number
of different averages modes, all of which are contained within
the namespace ``AvgMode``. An instance of such type can then be
used as additional parameter to :func:`value`, :func:`deriv`, and
:func:`deriv2`, as we will see further down.

It follows a list of available average modes. Each of which with
a short description of what their effect would be when used as an
additional parameter to the functions mentioned above.

.. class:: AvgMode.None

   Used by default. This will cause the element-wise results to
   be returned.

.. class:: AvgMode.Sum

   Causes the method to return the unweighted sum of the
   elements instead of the individual elements. Can be used in
   combination with ``ObsDim``, in which case a vector will be
   returned containing the sum for each observation (useful
   mainly for multivariable regression).

.. class:: AvgMode.Mean

   Causes the method to return the unweighted mean of the
   elements instead of the individual elements. Can be used in
   combination with ``ObsDim``, in which case a vector will be
   returned containing the mean for each observation (useful
   mainly for multivariable regression).

.. class:: AvgMode.WeightedSum

   Causes the method to return the weighted sum of all
   observations. The variable ``weights`` has to be a vector of
   the same length as the number of observations. If ``normalize
   = true``, the values of the weight vector will be normalized
   in such as way that they sum to one.

   .. attribute:: weights

      Vector of weight values that can be used to give certain
      observations a stronger influence on the sum.

      .. code-block:: jlcon

         julia> AvgMode.WeightedSum([1,1,2]); # 3 observations

   .. attribute:: normalize

      Boolean that specifies if the weight vector should be
      transformed in such a way that it sums to one (i.e.
      normalized). This will not mutate the weight vector but
      instead happen on the fly during the accumulation.

      Defaults to ``false``. Setting it to ``true`` only really
      makes sense in multivalue-regression, otherwise the result
      will be the same as for :class:`WeightedMean`.

      .. code-block:: jlcon

         julia> AvgMode.WeightedSum([1,1,2], normalize = true);

.. class:: AvgMode.WeightedMean

   Causes the method to return the weighted mean of all
   observations. The variable ``weights`` has to be a vector of
   the same length as the number of observations. If ``normalize
   = true``, the values of the weight vector will be normalized
   in such as way that they sum to one.

   .. attribute:: weights

      Vector of weight values that can be used to give certain
      observations a stronger influence on the mean.

      .. code-block:: jlcon

         julia> AvgMode.WeightedMean([1,1,2]); # 3 observations

   .. attribute:: normalize

      Boolean that specifies if the weight vector should be
      transformed in such a way that it sums to one (i.e.
      normalized). This will not mutate the weight vector but
      instead happen on the fly during the accumulation.

      Defaults to ``true``. Setting it to ``false`` only really
      makes sense in multivalue-regression, otherwise the result
      will be the same as for :class:`WeightedSum`.

      .. code-block:: jlcon

         julia> AvgMode.WeightedMean([1,1,2], normalize = false);

Unweighted Sum and Mean
-------------------------

As hinted before, we provide special memory efficient methods for
computing the **sum** or the **mean** of the element-wise (or
broadcasted) results of :func:`value`, :func:`deriv`, and
:func:`deriv2`. These methods avoid the allocation of a temporary
array and instead compute the result directly.

.. function:: value(loss, targets, outputs, avgmode) -> Number

   Computes the **unweighted** sum or mean (depending on
   `avgmode`) of the individual values of the loss function for
   each pair in `targets` and `outputs`. This method will not
   allocate a temporary array.

   In the case that the two parameters are arrays with a
   different number of dimensions, broadcast will be performed.
   Note that the given parameters are expected to have the same
   size in the dimensions they share.

   Note: This function should always be type-stable. If it isn't,
   you likely found a bug.

   :param loss: The loss-function we are interested in.
   :type loss: :class:`SupervisedLoss`
   :param AbstractArray targets: The array of ground truths
                                 :math:`\mathbf{y}`.
   :param AbstractArray outputs: The array of predicted outputs
                                 :math:`\mathbf{\hat{y}}`.
   :param AverageMode avgmode: Must either be :func:`AvgMode.Sum()` or
                               :func:`AvgMode.Mean()`
   :return: The unweighted sum or mean of the individual values
            of the loss function for all values in `targets` and
            `outputs`.
   :rtype: Number

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), [1,2,3], [2,5,-2], AvgMode.Sum())
   9

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), [1.,2,3], [2,5,-2], AvgMode.Sum())
   9.0

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), [1,2,3], [2,5,-2], AvgMode.Mean())
   3.0

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), Float32[1,2,3], Float32[2,5,-2], AvgMode.Mean())
   3.0f0

The exact same method signature is also implemented for
:func:`deriv` and :func:`deriv2` respectively.

.. function:: deriv(loss, targets, outputs, avgmode) -> Number

   Computes the **unweighted** sum or mean (depending on
   `avgmode`) of the individual derivatives of the loss function
   for each pair in `targets` and `outputs`. This method will not
   allocate a temporary array.

   In the case that the two parameters are arrays with a
   different number of dimensions, broadcast will be performed.
   Note that the given parameters are expected to have the same

                                 :math:`\mathbf{\hat{y}}`.

                               :func:`AvgMode.Mean()`
   :return: The unweighted sum or mean of the individual
            derivatives of the loss function for all values in
            `targets` and `outputs`.

   -0.6666666666666665


.. function:: deriv2(loss, targets, outputs, avgmode) -> Number

   Computes the **unweighted** sum or mean (depending on
   `avgmode`) of the individual 2nd derivatives of the loss
   function for each pair in `targets` and `outputs`. This
   method will not allocate a temporary array.

   In the case that the two parameters are arrays with a
   different number of dimensions, broadcast will be performed.
   Note that the given parameters are expected to have the same
   size in the dimensions they share.

   julia> deriv2(LogitDistLoss(), [1.,2,3], [2,5,-2], AvgMode.Mean())

Sum and Mean per Observation
-----------------------------

When the targets and predicted outputs are multi-dimensional
arrays instead of vectors, we may be interested in accumulating
the values over all but one dimension. This is typically the case
when we work in a multi-variable regression setting, where each
observation has multiple outputs and thus multiple targets. In
those scenarios we may be more interested in the average loss for
each observation, rather than the total average over all the
data.

To be able to accumulate the values for each observation
separately, we have to know and explicitly specify the dimension
that denotes the observations. For that purpose we provide the
types contained in the namespace ``ObsDim``.

.. function:: value(loss, targets, outputs, avgmode, obsdim) -> Vector

   Computes the values of the loss function for each pair in
   `targets` and `outputs` individually, and returns either the
   **unweighted** sum or mean for each observation (depending on
   `avgmode`). This method will not allocate a temporary array,
   but it will allocate the resulting vector.

   Both arrays have to be of the same shape and size. Furthermore
   they have to have at least two array dimensions (i.e. they
   must not be vectors).

   Note: This function should always be type-stable. If it isn't,
   you likely found a bug.

   :param loss: The loss-function we are interested in.
   :type loss: :class:`SupervisedLoss`
   :param AbstractArray targets: The multi-dimensional array of
                                 ground truths :math:`\mathbf{y}`.
   :param AbstractArray outputs: The multi-dimensional array of
                                 predicted outputs
                                 :math:`\mathbf{\hat{y}}`.
   :param AverageMode avgmode: Must either be :func:`AvgMode.Sum()` or
                               :func:`AvgMode.Mean()`
   :param ObsDimension obsdim: Specifies which of the array
                               dimensions denotes the observations.
                               see ``?ObsDim`` for more information.
   :return: A vector that contains the unweighted sums / means
            of the loss for each observation in `targets` and
            `outputs`.
   :rtype: Vector

Consider the following two matrices, ``targets`` and ``outputs``.
There are two ways to interpret the shape of these arrays if one
dimension is to denote the observations.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> targets = rand(2,4)
   2×4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.0743675  0.285303  0.247157  0.223666
    0.513145   0.59224   0.32325   0.989964

   julia> outputs = rand(2,4)
   2×4 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.6335    0.319131  0.637087  0.613777
    0.513495  0.264587  0.533555  0.714688

The first interpretation would be to say that the first dimension
denotes the observations. Thus this data would consist of two
observations with four variables each.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), targets, outputs, AvgMode.Sum(), ObsDim.First())
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    1.373
    0.813583

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), targets, outputs, AvgMode.Mean(), ObsDim.First())
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.34325
    0.203396

The second possible interpretation would be to say that the
second/last dimension denotes the observations. In that case our
data consists of four observations with two variables each.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> value(L1DistLoss(), targets, outputs, AvgMode.Sum(), ObsDim.Last())
   4-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.559482
    0.36148
    0.600235
    0.665386

    0.279741
    0.18074
    0.300118
    0.332693

Because this method returns a vector of values, we also provide a
mutating version that can make use a preallocated vector to write
the results into.

.. function:: value!(buffer, loss, targets, outputs, avgmode, obsdim) -> Vector

   Computes the values of the loss function for each pair in
   `targets` and `outputs` individually, and returns either the
   **unweighted** sum or mean for each observation, depending on
   `avgmode`. The results are stored into the given vector
   `buffer`. This method will not allocate a temporary array.

   Both arrays have to be of the same shape and size. Furthermore
   they have to have at least two array dimensions (i.e. so they
   must not be vectors).

   Note: This function should always be type-stable. If it isn't,
   you likely found a bug.

   :param buffer: Array to store the computed values in.
                  Old values will be overwritten and lost.
   :type buffer: `AbstractVector`
   :param loss: The loss-function we are interested in.
   :type loss: :class:`SupervisedLoss`
   :param AbstractArray targets: The multi-dimensional array of
                                 ground truths :math:`\mathbf{y}`.
   :param AbstractArray outputs: The multi-dimensional array of
                                 predicted outputs
                                 :math:`\mathbf{\hat{y}}`.
   :param AverageMode avgmode: Must either be :func:`AvgMode.Sum()` or
                               :func:`AvgMode.Mean()`
   :param ObsDimension obsdim: Specifies which of the array
                               dimensions denotes the observations.
                               see ``?ObsDim`` for more information.
   :return: `buffer` (for convenience).

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> buffer = zeros(2);

   julia> value!(buffer, L1DistLoss(), targets, outputs, AvgMode.Sum(), ObsDim.First())
   2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    1.373
    0.813583

    0.279741
    0.18074
    0.300118
    0.332693

We also provide both of these methods for :func:`deriv` and
:func:`deriv2` respectively.

.. function:: deriv(loss, targets, outputs, avgmode, obsdim) -> Vector

Same as below, but using the 1st derivative.

.. function:: deriv2(loss, targets, outputs, avgmode, obsdim) -> Vector

   Computes the (2nd) derivatives of the loss function for each
   pair in `targets` and `outputs` individually and returns
   either the **unweighted** sum or mean for each observation
   (depending on `avgmode`). This method will not allocate a
   temporary array, but it will allocate the resulting vector.

   Both arrays have to be of the same shape and size. Furthermore
   they have to have at least two array dimensions (i.e. so they

Weighted Sum and Mean
-------------------------

Up to this point, all the averaging was performed in an
unweighted manner. That means that each observation was treated
as equal and had thus the same potential influence on the result.
In this sub-section we will consider the situations in which we
do want to explicitly specify the influence of each observation
(i.e. we want to weigh them). When we say we "weigh" an
observation, what it effectively boils down to is multiplying the
result for that observation (i.e. the computed loss or
derivative) with some number. This is done for every observation
individually.

To get a better understand of what we are talking about, let us
consider performing a weighting scheme manually. The following
code will compute the loss for three observations, and then
multiply the result of the second observation with the number
``2``, while the other two remains as they are. If we then sum up
the results, we will see that the loss of the second observation
was effectively counted twice.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> result = value.(L1DistLoss(), [1.,2,3], [2,5,-2]) .* [1,2,1]
   3-element Array{Float64,1}:
    1.0
    6.0
    5.0

   julia> sum(result)
   12.0

The point of weighing observations is to inform the learning
algorithm we are working with, that it is more important to us to
predict some observations correctly than it is for others. So
really, the concrete weight-factor matters less than the ratio
between the different weights. In the example above the second
observation was thus considered twice as important as any of the
other two observations.

In the case of multi-dimensional arrays the process isn't that
simple anymore. In such a scenario, computing the weighted sum
(or weighted mean) can be thought of as having an additional
step. First we either compute the sum or (unweighted) average
for each observation (which results in a vector), and then we
compute the weighted sum of all observations.

The following code snipped demonstrates how to compute the
``AvgMode.WeightedSum([2,1])`` manually. This is **not** meant as
an example of how to do it, but simply to show what is happening
qualitatively. In this example we assume that we are working in a
multi-variable regression setting, in which our data set has four
observations with two target-variables each.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   julia> targets = rand(2,4)
   2×4 Array{Float64,2}:

   # WARNING: BAD CODE - ONLY FOR ILLUSTRATION

   julia> tmp = sum(value.(L1DistLoss(), targets, outputs),2) # assuming ObsDim.First()
   2×1 Array{Float64,2}:
    1.373
    0.813584

   julia> sum(tmp .* [2, 1]) # weigh 1st observation twice as high
   3.559587

To manually compute the result for
``AvgMode.WeightedMean([2,1])`` we follow a similar approach, but
use the normalized weight vector in the last step.

.. code-block:: jlcon

   # WARNING: BAD CODE - ONLY FOR ILLUSTRATION

   julia> tmp = mean(value.(L1DistLoss(), targets, outputs),2) # ObsDim.First()
   2×1 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.34325
    0.203396

   julia> sum(tmp .* [0.6666, 0.3333]) # weigh 1st observation twice as high
   0.29660258677499995

Note that you can specify explicitly if you want to normalize the
weight vector. That option is supported for computing the
weighted sum, as well as for computing the weighted mean. See the
documentation for :class:`AvgMode.WeightedSum` and
:class:`AvgMode.WeightedMean` for more information.

The code-snippets above are of course very inefficient, because
they allocate (multiple) temporary arrays. We only included them
to demonstrate what is happening in terms of desired result /
effect. For doing those computations efficiently we provide
special methods for :func:`value`, :func:`deriv`, :func:`deriv2`
and their mutating counterparts.

.. function:: value(loss, targets, outputs, wavgmode, [obsdim]) -> Number

   Computes the values of the loss function for each pair in
   `targets` and `outputs` individually and returns either the
   **weighted** sum or mean for each observation (depending on
   `wavgmode`). This method will not allocate a temporary array.
   Both arrays have to be of the same shape and size.

   Note: This function should always be type-stable. If it isn't,
   you likely found a bug.

   :param loss: The loss-function we are interested in.
   :type loss: :class:`SupervisedLoss`
   :param AbstractArray targets: The array of ground truths
                                 :math:`\mathbf{y}`.
   :param AbstractArray outputs: The array of predicted outputs
                                 :math:`\mathbf{\hat{y}}`.
   :param AverageMode wavgmode: Must either be of type
                                :class:`AvgMode.WeightedSum` or
                                :class:`AvgMode.WeightedMean`.
                                Either way, the specified weight
                                vector must have the same number
                                of observations as `targets` and
                                `outputs`.
   :param ObsDimension obsdim: Optional. Default to ``ObsDim.Last()``.
                               Specifies which of the array
                               dimensions denotes the
                               observations. see ``?ObsDim`` for
                               more information.
   :return: A vector that contains the unweighted sums / means
            of the loss for each observation in `targets` and
            `outputs`.

We also provide both of these methods for :func:`deriv` and
:func:`deriv2` respectively.

.. function:: deriv(loss, targets, outputs, wavgmode, [obsdim]) -> Number

Same as below, but using the 1st derivative.

.. function:: deriv2(loss, targets, outputs, wavgmode, [obsdim]) -> Number

   Computes the (2nd) derivatives of the loss function for each
   pair in `targets` and `outputs` individually and returns
   either the **weighted** sum or mean for each observation
   (depending on `wavgmode`). This method will not allocate a
   temporary array. Both arrays have to be of the same shape and
   size.

   Note: This function should always be type-stable. If it isn't,
   you likely found a bug.

                                Either way, the specified weight
                                vector must have the same number
                                of observations as `targets` and
